# My Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! This is where I showcase my work, skills, and projects. Feel free to explore and get to know more about me and my work.


## Introduction

This is the codebase for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a central hub where I display my resume, share my projects, and provide a way for visitors to get in touch with me. I created 
this project in my second year of my undergraduation to get an hands on experience on web development. So I used plain Vanilla css and javascript to make a fully responsive website on my own
to get a hands on experience in web development. To be frank this website will be amateur to my recent projects. I am very happy to share that this is my first personal portfolio website 
and it also helps to see my progress to where I am standing today.
